Karabiner-Elements configuration file paths:

-   `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`
    -   Main configuration file.<br />
        Karabiner-Elements watches this file and reload it automatically when it is updated.
-   `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`
    -   Imported complex_modifications files.<br />
        You can use them in Karabiner-Elements Settings > Complex Modifications > Add predefined rule.

{{% alert title="Tip: file update detection and automatic reload" color="primary" %}}

Karabiner-Elements watches `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json` and reloads it if updated.

The mechanism is that Karabiner-Elements watches the parent directory `~/.config/karabiner` by using the File System Events API.<br />
Thus, Karabiner-Elements fails detecting file updates after you change the parent directory (e.g., recreate the parent directory).
